Steps tp connect Athena with Tableau

Install the latest version of 64-bit Java.
Get the driver (download here).
Place the driver:
Windows: Save the Amazon Athena JDBC jar in the C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers location.
Mac: Save the Amazon Athena JDBC jar in the ~/Library/Tableau/Drivers location.
Restart Tableau.
Once these steps are completed, you can add a new Amazon Athena connection and begin configuring it.

There are a few interesting things to note about the connection dialog for Amazon Athena. The lack of an SSL checkbox is not an indicator for a lack of support. In fact, Amazon Athena uses SSL all the time, so be sure to specify port 443.



The remainder of the dialog is straight-forward. For the advanced users among us, here’s the nitty-gritty:

Server: athena.region.amazon.com
for example, Athena.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Port: 443
SSL by default
Amazon S3 Staging Directory: Find this setting in the AWS console for Amazon Athena.
AWS calls this property “Query Result Location”
Username/Password: Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
Access Key ID and Secret Access Key associated with the IAM user you are logging in as
